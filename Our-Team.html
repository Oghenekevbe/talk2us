                    Lindsey Peacock is Psychiatrist, editor, and devoted bookworm based in Toronto, Canada. While she
                    currently is a Senior Resident for Talk2-Us, she’s been slinging copy for more than
                    a
                    decade.

                    When she isn’t typing furiously on her ancient Macbook, you’ll find her cruising around town with
                    her
                    beloved ginger husky Charlie.
